# Multiple-Plant-Disease-Detection
 This project involves collecting extensive data encompassing four plant species afflicted by multiple diseases, followed by thorough data preprocessing. Subsequently, a series of artificial neural network (ANN) models are trained to accurately classify plant species and detect diseases
